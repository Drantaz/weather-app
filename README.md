# Weather App Project README

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a weather application using Next.js, Axios for API requests, and implementing a UI design using Figma. The project will also include creating UML diagrams and following requirement gathering and use case documentation.

## Project Timeline

### Week 1
- [ ] Create a new branch from the main branch.
- [ ] Research and select a free weather API.
- [ ] Set up the project structure in Next.js.
- [ ] Research and compile a list of requirements for the weather app.
- [ ] Research how to create requirement gathering documents and use cases.

### Week 2
- [ ] Start creating a Requirements Gathering Document.
- [ ] Continue work on the Requirements Gathering Document.
- [ ] Create a basic UML diagram for the project.

### Week 3
- [ ] Begin designing the user interface using Figma.
- [ ] Finalize the Requirements Gathering Document.
- [ ] Complete the UML diagrams.

### Week 4
- [ ] Finish designing the UI in Figma.
- [ ] Start implementing the code using Next.js and Axios.

## Recommended Weather API
For this project, I recommend using the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/). It offers free access to weather data and is widely used in various weather applications.

## Conclusion

Remember to maintain regular progress and collaborate with your supervisor as necessary and also request for regular reviews. Good luck!
